        <p>This project was created using what I learned in AP Computer Science A and UGA's Introduction to Computing class (CSCI 1301) to make a silly program that assists in providing gift choices from my family!</p>

        <h2>EventCast&#8480;</h2> <br>
        <p>EventCast is a project designed to help users plan their day by combining data from two APIs: OpenWeatherMap and SeatGeek. The program retrieves the user's location, checks for any events happening within a 20 mile radius, and checks the weather forecast for the day. The program will then display the event information and notify the user whether it is likely to rain during the event. This project aims to provide users with a simple and convenient tool for planning their day, taking into account both weather and local events.</p>
        <p>Please contact me directly to access the GitHub repository, as I do not desire to have the repository publicly available with my API keys accessible.</p>

          Although my experience with Javascript, HTML, and CSS is currently limited,
          I am highly motivated to continue to improve my skills through learning and practice.
          My ultimate goal is to create innovative and useful
          digital solutions that can benefit not only my friends and family, but
          also the broader community. While this website may be my first step into
          the world of digital publishing, I view it as a beginning 
          towards achieving my long-term aspirations.</p>
